Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

This repository documents my deliberate practice and application of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. The goal is to master efficient problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews and complex engineering work.

Topics Covered
 Arrays & Strings
 Linked Lists, Stacks, & Queues
 Trees & Graphs (BFS, DFS)
 Recursion & Backtracking
 Hashing & Maps
 Sorting & Searching Algorithms

Practice Platforms
Solutions are primarily derived from HackerRank and LeetCode. Each solution includes comments on the **Time Complexity ($O(n)$)** and **Space Complexity O(n).

Current Status
Target: 250+ Medium/Hard problems by Summer Internship Season.
